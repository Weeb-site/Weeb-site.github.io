</div>

    	<div class="haber_metni_ust"> Did you know that there is a relationship between hair colors and personalities of anime characters?</div>
        <div class="haber_medyasi"> <img src="https://www.animeler.net/upload/media/entries/2022-08/19/6274-entry-0-1660932006.jpg"></div> 


        <p>In anime, colors are used as a symbol of characters' personalities, but since colors are not the only way to express personalities, the connection between colors and personality is not completely consistent. Still, it is an undeniable fact that there is a connection between the personalities and hair colors of anime characters.
</p>

        <p>While colors and the symbolic meanings attributed to them vary from culture to culture, they are also similar due to cross-cultural interaction. Now let's look at how colors are reflected on the characters in anime, which is a work of Japanese culture.</p>

        <h3>Black hair</h3>
        <div class="haber_medyasi"><img src="https://www.animeler.net/upload/media/entries/2022-08/19/6274-entry-0_0-1660932005.jpg"></div> 
        <div class="aciklama">(L- Death Note, Lelouch Lamperouge - Code Geass, Roy Mustang - FMA, Kagome Higurashi - Inuyasha, Mio Akiyama - K-ON!, Mikasa Ackerman - AOT)</div><br>

        <p>They are mysterious, elegant, intelligent, talented, strong, cool, ruthless and honorable characters. Black-haired characters, who have more good points than bad points, are wise and farsighted.</p>
        
       <h3> Brown hair</h3>

       <div class="haber_medyasi"><img src="https://www.animeler.net/upload/media/entries/2022-08/19/6274-entry-0_1-1660932006.jpg"></div> 
        <div class="aciklama">(Yagami Light - Death Note, Shinichi Izumi - Kiseijuu, Kiyotaka Ayanokouji - Classroom of Elite, Yuuki Cross - Vampire Knight, Naho Takamiya - Orange, Yui Hirasawa - K-ON)</div>

        <p>Friendly, attractive, comfortable. Although this hair color is one of the most commonly used hair colors, the main characters of school and daily life-themed anime usually have brown hair. These friendly and attractive characters leave unforgettable impressions on the audience.</p>
       
        <h3> Kızıl Saç</h3>

        <div class="haber_medyasi"><img src="https://www.animeler.net/upload/media/entries/2022-08/19/6274-entry-0_2-1660932006.jpg"></div> 
        <div class="aciklama">(Shanks - One Piece, Kagami Taiga - KNB, Gaara - Naruto, Erza Scarlet - Fairy Tail, Shirayuki - Snow White with the Red Hair, Kushina Uzumaki - Naruto) </div><br>

        <p>Aggressive, stubborn, strong, emotional, attractive. Red-haired characters are very striking in terms of their appearance, and they also have very strong personalities. These characters, whom we often witness experiencing emotional outbursts, are also hard-working characters with a developed sense of responsibility.</p>
       
        <h3>Pink Hair</h3>

        <div class="haber_medyasi"><img src="https://www.animeler.net/upload/media/entries/2022-08/19/6274-entry-0_3-1660932006.jpg"></div> 
        <div class="aciklama">(Natsu Dragneel - Fairy Tail, Renzo Shima - Blue Exorcist, Yuuji Itadori - Jujutsu Kaisen, Sakura Haruno - Naruto, Ram - Re:ZERO, Zero Two - Darling in the FranXX)</div><br>

        <p>Cute, pure, energetic, emotional, stubborn. Because these characters make decisions based on their emotions and act impulsively, you may sometimes find them annoying. </p>
   
        <h3>Purple Hair</h3>
        
        <div class="haber_medyasi"><img src="https://www.animeler.net/upload/media/entries/2022-08/19/6274-entry-0_4-1660932006.jpg"></div> 
        <div class="aciklama">(Sinbad - AOS, Atsushi Murasakibara - KNB, Ayota Kirishima - Tokyo Ghoul, Hitagi Senjougahara - Bakemonogatari, Yuri Nakamura - Angel Beats, Shinoa Hiragi - Owari no Seraph)</div><br>

        <p>Strong, moody, mysterious, intelligent, pessimistic. Characters with purple hair are generally characters who do not establish close relationships with other characters and look down on others. They make a very cool impression with their intelligence and strength.</p>

        <h3>Green Hair</h3>

        <div class="haber_medyasi"><img src="https://www.animeler.net/upload/media/entries/2022-08/19/6274-entry-0_5-1660932006.jpg"></div> 
        <div class="aciklama">(Zoro Roronoa - One Piece, Shintarou Midorima - KNB, Izuku Midoriya - MHA, Hanako Koyanagi - Wotakoi, C.C. - Code Geass, Tsuyu Asui - MHA)</div><br>
          
        <p>Hardworking, determined, reliable. These characters have many good qualities, but the first impression they give is not the best. They are generally loved when their stories are learned.</p>
   
       <h3>Blue Hair</h3>

       <div class="haber_medyasi"><img src="https://www.animeler.net/upload/media/entries/2022-08/19/6274-entry-0_6-1660932006.jpg"></div> 
       <div class="aciklama">(Kuroko Tetsuya - KNB, Nagisa Shiota - Assassination Classroom, Kamina - Gurren Lagan, Juvia Lockser - Fairy Tail, Rem - Re:ZERO, Esdeath - Akame ga Kill)</div><br>

       <p>Quiet, calm, smart, ambitious, talented. Blue-haired anime characters are intelligent characters with strong feelings of empathy. They have many good qualities, and anime characters with dark blue hair are generally arrogant.</p>

       <h3>Orange hair</h3>
       <div class="aciklama">(Naruto Uzumaki - Naruto, Arataka Reigen - Mob Psycho 100, Zenitsu Agatsuma, Demon Slayer, Tsumugi Kotobuki - K-ON, Kaori Miyazono - Your Lie in April, Violet Evergarden - Violet Evergarden)</div><br>
   
       <div class="haber_medyasi"><img src="https://www.animeler.net/upload/media/entries/2022-08/19/6274-entry-0_7-1660932006.jpg"></div> 
       <div class="aciklama">(Pain - Naruto, Ichigo Kurosaki - Bleach, Hinata Shouyou - Haikyuu, Nami - One Piece, Orihime Inoue - Bleach, Emma - The Promised Nverland)</div><br>

       <p>Energetic, brave, strong, optimistic. They have a strong aura. They attract attention and do it effortlessly. They have unforgettable and powerful stories.</p>
    
      <h3>Blond hair</h3>

      <div class="haber_medyasi"><img src="https://www.animeler.net/upload/media/entries/2022-08/19/6274-entry-0_8-1660932006.jpg"></div> 
      <div class="aciklama">(Naruto Uzumaki - Naruto, Arataka Reigen - Mob Psycho 100, Zenitsu Agatsuma, Demon Slayer, Tsumugi Kotobuki - K-ON, Kaori Miyazono - Your Lie in April, Violet Evergarden - Violet Evergarden)</div><br>

      <p>Silly, naive, stubborn, childish, reliable. Blonde anime characters, who combine many contrasting characteristics, are self-confident. Depending on the outcome, they can be reliable and a leader in the eyes of others, or a child who takes on things that are beyond his ability. In general, they have pure and lovable personalities.</p>
    
      <h3>White/Grey Hair</h3>

      <div class="haber_medyasi"><img src="https://www.animeler.net/upload/media/entries/2022-08/19/6274-entry-0_9-1660932006.jpg"></div> 
      <div class="aciklama">(Hatake Kakashi - Naruto, Killua Zoldyck - HxH, Kaneki Ken - Tokyo Ghoul, Nao Tomori - Charlotte, Kanade Tachibana - Angel Beats, Mirajane Strauss - Fairy Tail)</div><br>

      <p>Mature, strong, intelligent, reckless, mysterious, extraordinary. Since these characters generally have a sad past, they are careless and carefree about the negativities that happen to them. They have a strong mentality. They are characters who, instead of giving up, have learned to walk with what their pain has left them with.</p>
    
      <h3>Kuroko no Basket</h3>

      <div class="haber_medyasi"><img src="https://ae01.alicdn.com/kf/HTB1Ti62NVXXXXbYXFXXq6xXFXXXG/Kuroko-basketbol-Anime-karakterler-45-45CM-kare-yast-k-k-l-f-yast-k-k-l.jpg"></div> 

      <p>Let's now examine some of these colors in a single anime. Kuroko no Basket anime, which has a connection between the characters' hair colors, personalities and names, is one of the anime in which the personality traits symbolized by the colors are most clearly visible.</p> 

        <p><bold>Kuroko;</bold> light blue hair. He is smart, talented, very good at reading people, quiet, calm, and unnoticeable at first glance. Kuro means black in Japanese and is called shadow in the anime. </p>
        
        <p><bold>Aomine;</bold> dark blue hair. Smart, talented, ambitious and cocky. Aomine is a strong and cocky character in the anime. He is a cocky character rather than determined like Kuroko, these aspects changed with his character development towards the end of the anime. Ao means blue in Japanese. </p>
        
        <p><bold> Akashi;</bold> red-headed. A stubborn, strong, attractive and self-confident character. It attracts attention at first glance. Aka means red in Japanese.</p>
        
        <p><bold>Midorima;</bold> green hair. He is a hardworking, determined, reliable and somewhat cold character. Midori means green in Japanese.</p>
        
        <p><bold>Murasakibara;</bold> purple hair. A strong, intelligent, grumpy, arrogant character. Murasaki means purple in Japanese.</p>
        
        <p><bold>Kise;</bold> blonde hair. Besides being a silly, childish, stubborn character, he is also very likable. Kiiro means yellow in Japanese.</p>
        
         
        
        <p>Although colors generally symbolize these personalities in characters, there are of course characters that differ. In addition, I wanted to draw attention to the common aspects between anime characters with the same hair color, which at first glance do not look very similar to each other, and I prepared the visuals accordingly. In general, I also used the sotaku.com website in the list I prepared based on my own analysis and findings.</p> 
        
        <p>Do you have any general anime characters or features under your color headings?</p>
